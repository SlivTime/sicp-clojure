;; Exercise 1.8: Newtonâ€™s method for cube roots is based on 
;; the fact that if y is an approximation to the cube root of x, 
;; then a better approximation is given by the value
;; ((x / y^2) + 2*y) / 3
;; Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure 
;; analogous to the square-root procedure.
